# VBA-Challenge
The homework instructions tell us to let you know if we recieved help or got some code via outside sources.
I did get some help via google and stack overflow as well as some guidance on format from a friend of mine who uses VBA some at his job.
I did not save a link to each source, and not sure exactly how you guys like to see that if we do get some help from outside sources.
Thanks.
